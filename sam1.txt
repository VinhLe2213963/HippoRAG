Title:The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried
Passage:The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, goes beyond his guilt or innocence — it could damage the entire crypto industry. He faces seven criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy, with prosecutors alleging he misused billions in customer funds for personal gain, investments, and political donations. FTX, once promoted as a safe and transparent platform, had secret code allowing Alameda Research — also founded by Bankman-Fried — to access unlimited funds. The government must prove he acted with intent, using messages, tweets, and testimony from former insiders like Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. The trial may reveal embarrassing details about other investors and industry leaders. As Bankman-Fried defends himself, possibly blaming Binance, legal advisors, or industry norms, the broader crypto sector risks further reputational harm.
