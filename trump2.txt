Title:The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer
Passage:Financial documents released during Trump's trial reveal discrepancies in property valuations, highlighting the debate around his net worth. While Trump's 2021 statement claimed a $4.5 billion net worth, Bloomberg's calculations differ, sometimes valuing properties higher than New York State. The core dispute centers on properties like Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Fifth Avenue penthouse, Trump Park Avenue, and 40 Wall Street, where prosecutors allege inflated valuations. Trump defended his figures, citing his brand's premium and arguing banks didn't heavily rely on his financial statements. Experts debate the true value of these assets, considering factors like zoning restrictions, market comparisons, and the impact of the Trump name.
