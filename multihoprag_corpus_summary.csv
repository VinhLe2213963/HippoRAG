Commissioner Thierry Breton sent an 'urgent' letter to Musk, citing indications that X is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation, and reminding him of the DSA's obligations. The EU has given Musk 24 hours to respond. Penalties for DSA breaches can be as high as 6% of global annual turnover, and access to X could be shut off in the region if the platform repeatedly fails to comply."

Is Sam Bankman-Fried a bad ‘man’ or a good ‘boy’? Lawyers swap opening statements before first witnesses take the stand,"Sam Bankman-Fried's trial began with contrasting opening statements. Prosecutors portrayed him as a liar who stole billions to fund a lavish lifestyle, using Alameda Research and Caroline Ellison to access FTX customer funds and falsify documents.

The prosecution then called Marc-Antoine Julliard, an FTX customer who lost nearly $100,000, and Adam Yedidia, an MIT friend who joined Bankman-Fried at Alameda and FTX, the stand. Yedidia testified that he had legal immunity due to his concern that he had unknowingly contributed to a crime.","Title:Is Sam Bankman-Fried a bad ‘man’ or a good ‘boy’?

Unlike its case against Apple, Epic can't claim there's no alternative to Google Play because Android allows sideloading, though Epic argues Google makes it cumbersome. Epic will argue that Google has anticompetitive agreements with device manufacturers and developers violating the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, and the Unfair Competition Law. Google charges app developers a 15% to 30% commission, but Google offers 'User Choice Billing,' reducing commissions by 4% for developers using their own payment processing. Google will argue commissions help fund features, user safety, and developer tools. Google also contends the Play Store faces competition from Apple's App Store and other Android app stores. Epic argues Google hinders alternative app stores with bundling and 'Anti-Fragmentation Agreements' (AFAs). Epic will also highlight 'Project Hug,' where Google allegedly paid developers to remain on the Play Store. Google will argue this incentivized developers to launch on Android alongside iOS. Google allows sideloading, but Epic argues the process is deliberately difficult. Google claims this case is about Epic avoiding paying commissions. The trial involves testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, and others. Epic previously lost an antitrust battle with Apple and is appealing to the Supreme Court.","Title:What to know about Fortnite maker Epic Games’ antitrust battle with Google, starting today

How the OpenAI fiasco could bolster Meta and the ‘open AI’ movement,"The recent OpenAI turmoil, triggered by the ousting of its CEO Sam Altman, has highlighted the risks of relying on centralized, proprietary AI systems. This situation has led to increased interest in 'open AI' approaches, championed by figures like Meta's Yann LeCun, who advocate for more transparency and collaboration in AI development. While companies like OpenAI and Google's DeepMind argue that proprietary AI is safer, others believe that open source AI, despite its potential vulnerabilities, ultimately leads to safer and more trustworthy technology. Meta, through its Llama models and partnerships like the one with Hugging Face, is well-positioned to benefit from this shift, offering businesses an alternative to the closed ecosystems of companies like OpenAI, potentially diversifying their AI strategies and mitigating risks. Despite questions around how “open” Meta’s Llama models truly are, the OpenAI fallout has validated Meta's pursuit of openness, at least for now.","Title:How the OpenAI fiasco could bolster Meta and the ‘open AI’ movement

Psagot worth 80% less since Rani Zim bought it,"Since Rani Zim acquired Psagot Investment House for NIS 405 million in August 2021, its market cap has plummeted by 80% to just NIS 97 million.

Zim financed the acquisition with a loan, and despite investing nearly NIS 130 million of his own capital, his 62% stake is now worth only NIS 64 million. Psagot is now seeking to raise NIS 220 million in debt and has sold parts of its business.

Israel's defense undone by reliance on technology,"Israel's technologically advanced border fence with Gaza, completed in 2021, was intended to replace manned deployment with sensors, cameras, and patrols. However, on October 7th, Hamas easily disabled these systems with drones, exposing the illusion of security and the vulnerability of relying solely on technology. Experts argue that over-reliance on technology, coupled with a belief in its invulnerability, led to reduced troop deployment and a failure to anticipate unconventional threats like the use of drones and heavy machinery. This echoes historical examples like the US in Vietnam, where technological superiority failed against an enemy who adapted. The focus on technology, while increasing intelligence gathering capabilities, may have come at the expense of human intelligence and a comprehensive understanding of the threat, ultimately contributing to a strategic surprise.","Title:Israel's defense undone by reliance on technology

Bob Menendez, facing bribery charges, questioned Wall Street CEOs about how much their firms paid back to consumers at the direction of the CFPB for alleged violations, including illegal junk fees and fake accounts. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were unable to answer, with the total amount being nearly $4 billion. Menendez, whose own legal troubles involve bribery charges, argued this demonstrated the CFPB's benefit to consumers as the watchdog faces a Supreme Court case challenging its funding. The hearing also covered new regulations and overdraft fees, with Menendez highlighting how these fees disproportionately affect Black and brown communities and urging other banks to follow Citigroup's lead in eliminating them.","Title:Sen.

"Biden’s AI EO hailed as broad, but not deep without legislation to match","Biden's executive order (EO) on AI is seen as a 'stopgap' measure, limited by the lack of legislative support. Experts emphasize that without Congressional action, the EO can only promote voluntary practices and provide guidance. Senator Warner praised the EO's breadth but noted its lack of depth, echoing the need for legislation. While the EO instructs AI-focused groups, a comprehensive AI law remains distant. Some suggest a new federal agency for AI regulation, but that also requires legislation. The timing of the EO is questioned, potentially preempting Vice President Harris's message at a U.K. summit on AI and signaling a lack of trust in the EU's collaborative process.","Title:Biden’s AI EO hailed as broad, but not deep without legislation to match

How OpenAI's ChatGPT has changed the world in just a year,"In its first year, ChatGPT rapidly gained popularity, reaching 100 million monthly active users faster than any internet application before it. It has been integrated into numerous fields, from academia to medicine, with significant backing from Silicon Valley. OpenAI had been developing GPT since 2016 and released ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) in November 2022. Its release coincided with the public's growing familiarity with generative AI, thanks to the popularity of image generators like DALL-E 2. Despite initial limitations, ChatGPT's capabilities far surpassed existing digital assistants. The year saw continuous user growth, new integrations, rival AI debuts, and regulatory pushback, including a temporary ban in Italy over data privacy concerns. OpenAI released iOS and Android apps, and Microsoft integrated Bing Search. However, ChatGPT faced criticism for inaccuracies and copyright issues, leading to lawsuits. By Q4, OpenAI introduced GPTs and explored AI chip development. The company briefly experienced turmoil when CEO Sam Altman was fired and subsequently rehired. While some initially dismissed ChatGPT as a fad, its widespread adoption suggests a lasting impact, driven by revenue potential, investments, and fear of missing out. Future regulatory oversight could significantly shape ChatGPT's trajectory in the coming year.","Title:How OpenAI's ChatGPT has changed the world in just a year

Builds revolve around four main concepts: Fury dumping (using the Unbridled Rage Key Passive for high damage at a high Fury cost), Berserking (maintaining Berserk with the Unconstrained Key Passive for bonuses), Bleed (using the Gushing Wounds Key Passive for damage over time), and Weapon swapping (using the Walking Arsenal Key Passive for damage buffs). When creating a Barbarian build, choosing a Key Passive and selecting skills accordingly is crucial. Consider skills with Thorns or Shouts for added advantages."

Cranberries: A Thanksgiving Staple With a Rich History and Unique Biology,"Cranberries, domesticated around 200 years ago, are a Thanksgiving staple in U.S. households. Native Americans used wild cranberries in various foods, and cultivation began in 1816. Wisconsin is the top U.S. producer, followed by Massachusetts, Oregon, and New Jersey, with Canada also being a major grower. Cranberry flowers are hermaphroditic, allowing self-pollination, though bees assist too. They can reproduce sexually or asexually, offering benefits for diversity and cloning. Each berry contains air pockets for buoyancy and seed dispersal. Scientists are studying the cranberry's genetics to enhance desired traits like size and color, and understanding its evolutionary history aids in breeding efforts. Thanksgiving's timing aligns with cranberry harvest season, making them a natural addition to the holiday meal, with cranberry sauce recipes appearing as early as the 1700s.","Title:Cranberries: A Thanksgiving Staple With a Rich History and Unique Biology

Patterns of Surface Warming Matter for Climate Sensitivity,"A major challenge in climate science is reducing uncertainty in climate sensitivity estimates, which quantify Earth's surface warming in response to doubled CO2. This uncertainty stems from the aggregation of numerous processes, with clouds being a primary driver.

A degree of global warming spread evenly will cause a different radiative response than if that same warming is concentrated in a climate sweet spot (a location where surface warming produces efficient radiative damping).","Title:Patterns of Surface Warming Matter for Climate Sensitivity

Prop Betting - What is a Prop Bet?,"Prop bets are side bets on specific in-game events or statistical achievements, not tied to the game's outcome. They are popular year-round, especially during the Super Bowl. A prop bet can be something like LeBron James scoring over 20 points. While prop bets offer variety and are easy to understand, they can be difficult to research, tie up your bankroll, and exotic props are often a guessing game. Examples include player stats in the NBA, anytime touchdown scorers in the NFL, and pitcher strikeouts in MLB. Odds use American odds format. Exotic props, common during the Super Bowl, involve non-game scenarios like the halftime show or the color of the Gatorade bath. Always review sportsbook rules; for example, a player prop is usually voided if the player doesn't participate, but stands if they do.","Title:Prop Betting - What is a Prop Bet?

The best VPN services for 2023,"Engadget tested nine VPN services and recommends five top picks. VPNs mask your IP address and encrypt your traffic, but they don't protect against all threats like phishing. Prioritize strong passwords and multifactor authentication. VPNs are useful on public WiFi, for hiding browsing activity from your ISP, and for accessing geoblocked content. However, they can slow down your internet speed and may not be secure if based in countries with weak data privacy regulations. Consider open-source software, WireGuard protocol support, and defenses against attacks. For strong internet security consider Tor. Engadget's testing involved security specs, privacy policies, audits, and performance across iOS, Android, and Mac, including geoblocking, streaming, and gaming tests. The top picks are ProtonVPN (overall), Windscribe (free), ExpressVPN (streaming, travel, gaming), CyberGhost (cross-platform), and Surfshark (multiple devices). Other services tested include NordVPN, TunnelBear, Bitdefender VPN, and Atlas VPN. A VPN hides your IP address, location, and browser history but doesn't guarantee total anonymity. VPN safety varies by provider; check audits, reports, and policies. Google One VPN is available to subscribers in 22 countries and can be shared with up to five people.

5 things we learned so far about the Google antitrust case,"The U.S. government's antitrust trial against Google, focusing on its dominance in online search, has revealed key details.

Why the Apple Watch is being banned — and how Apple can avoid it,"The US ITC ruled Apple infringed on Masimo's patents related to blood oxygen (SpO2) technology, leading to an import ban on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 starting December 26th. Apple is preemptively pulling the watches from its online and physical stores. A presidential veto is unlikely, as these are rarely granted without public interest or health policy concerns. Apple is exploring legal options, including an appeal, but a stay on the ban is unlikely. A potential solution involves redesigning the Apple Watch to avoid the infringed patents, possibly by disabling or removing the SpO2 sensor; however, changes must be significant and not a mere workaround. Other options include a licensing deal with Masimo or manufacturing the watches in the US, but these are less likely in the short term. The Apple Watch SE is unaffected due to lacking the SpO2 feature. The ban doesn't prevent third party resellers from selling current inventory.","Title:Why the Apple Watch is being banned — and how Apple can avoid it

The Blueprint of Regeneration: Scientists Discover How to Turn Stem Cells’ Fate,"Researchers discovered the gene Daam1 is critical for activating Paneth cell development, a secretory cell type, in the intestines. Intestinal organoid studies showed that while the loss of both Rnf43 and Daam1 led to tumor-like growth in culture, only the absence of Rnf43 resulted in tumors in mouse intestines due to an overabundance of Paneth cells that produce growth factors. Daam1's role in Paneth cell formation sheds light on how stem cells differentiate and how tumor cells can modify their microenvironment to promote growth.","Title:The Blueprint of Regeneration: Scientists Discover How to Turn Stem Cells’ Fate

Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review,"Gary Wang, FTX's CTO and Alameda Research co-founder, testified about the 'allow_negative' column he implemented in FTX's database, granting Alameda a secret line of credit and exemption from automatic liquidation. This allowed Alameda to withdraw funds even with a negative balance, a privilege not afforded to normal users. Wang stated Bankman-Fried directed him to ensure Alameda's account was never liquidated. While Nishad Singh committed the code, Wang supervised it. This setup facilitated misleading claims about FTX's liquidation system and backstop fund, with Alameda even absorbing FTX's losses. Wang admitted knowing Alameda used FTX customer funds and that it was wrong. By 2022, Alameda's debt to FTX was substantial, leading to discussions among Wang, Ellison, Singh, and Bankman-Fried about repaying lenders with customer funds. Wang is cooperating with the government in hopes of leniency in sentencing. The author highlights that while conversations Wang described lack direct evidence, the code itself and Bankman-Fried's public statements strongly suggest his involvement, despite attempts to blame Ellison.","Title:Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review

"Fasting could reduce signs of Alzheimer’s disease, studies suggest: ‘Profound effects’","Studies suggest intermittent fasting could reduce the risk of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer's hallmarks. A study on mice showed time-restricted feeding improved memory, reduced hyperactivity and sleep disruptions, and decreased amyloid protein buildup in the brain.

Point Spread Betting - What is a Point Spread Bet?,"Point spread betting involves wagering on the difference in score between teams, with a point spread (handicap) assigned to the favored team to equalize the odds. You bet on whether the favorite will win by more than the spread or if the underdog will lose by less (or win outright). A point spread is set by bookmakers to level the playing field. The favorite has a negative point value, indicating how many points they must win by to cover the spread. The underdog has a positive point value, indicating how many points they can lose by and still cover the spread. If the underdog wins, they automatically cover. Sportsbooks often use half-points in their lines to avoid a 'push', which is when the difference in the game's score exactly matches the point spread, resulting in a refund of the original bet.","Title:Point Spread Betting - What is a Point Spread Bet?

Spider-Man 2 toys with Marvel history to be as much fun as possible,"Spider-Man 2, Insomniac's third Spidey game, features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales. The game emphasizes speed with web wings and faster web-swinging, making traversal a joy. The narrative involves two new villains, Kraven the Hunter and Venom, alongside returning villains. Peter's plot closely follows the Venom origin story, while Miles' story takes more liberties, integrating American Sign Language and Harlem's artistic history. The game hints at deeper themes but prioritizes spectacle and set-pieces.

How queerness became calamity in Tears of the Kingdom,"While Breath of the Wild offered space for queer expression, Tears of the Kingdom feels much more constrained. The game removes queer subtext from Gerudo Town, a gendered and raced space, by erasing characters like Vilia and altering the context of Gerudo armor. Now, Link is welcomed in Gerudo Town as a curiosity, and trans masculine possibilities are diminished. New armor sets don't offer explicitly feminine options, and Link's gender presentation is ridiculed across Hyrule through emasculating jokes. This creates a Hyrule with rigid gender expectations, suggesting that queer joy was only accepted in the unstructured wilds of a world facing calamity, but is no longer needed in a Hyrule reborn with a monarchy and new settlements. The Triforce, once a symbol of Power, Courage, and Wisdom, now seems to represent the gender binary.","Title:How queerness became calamity in Tears of the Kingdom

"5 myths about ketamine, the drug tied to Matthew Perry's death, according to doctors","After Matthew Perry’s cause of death was listed as ""acute effects of ketamine,"" experts addressed misconceptions about the drug. Ketamine is an anesthetic also used for treatment-resistant depression but has been used illegally as a recreational drug. Experts shared five myths: 1) Ketamine is a new treatment - it's been FDA-approved for decades, including for depression in 2019. 2) Ketamine is powerfully addictive - it's moderately addictive, with low addiction risk in clinical settings. 3) Ketamine can be self-prescribed and purchased online - it requires a licensed doctor's prescription. 4) Intranasal or micro-dosing is safe for recreational use - self-administration can lead to exceeding safe limits. 5) It’s hard to kick the habit - weaning off is typically not difficult with gradual dose adjustments. Ketamine can be dangerous if used at home unsupervised, in large doses, or mixed with other substances like opiates or buprenorphine, which was found in Perry's system. ASKP3 will soon publish guidelines for safe at-home use.","Title:5 myths about ketamine, the drug tied to Matthew Perry's death, according to doctors

Cavefish provide clues to the keto diet’s effect on autism-like behavior,"Clues from cave-dwelling fish suggest a link between the ketogenic diet, the brain, social behavior, and autism. The diet induces ketosis by shifting the body's energy source from carbs to fat, producing ketones. While popular for weight loss, the diet may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, potentially reducing seizures in children with epilepsy. Experiments with Mexican cavefish, which share brain region similarities with vertebrates and exhibit autism-like behaviors, revealed that a ketogenic diet modified their behavior to resemble more social surface fish. This suggests dopamine could be key to the diet's effect on behavior. Researchers are investigating how ketones act on mitochondria or epigenetics to influence gene expression, hoping to identify pathways for autism treatments.","Title:Cavefish provide clues to the keto diet’s effect on autism-like behavior

"Dear Disney: If you want to last another century, lay off the legacy","Disney's centennial celebration, exemplified by the movie 'Wish,' heavily relies on nostalgia, echoing past successes but lacking its own identity. While profitable, this reliance on legacy is unsustainable and antithetical to Disney's innovative spirit. Live-action remakes and sequels, though financially successful, diminish the original movies' legacies. Disney's real legacy lies in taking risks and embracing innovation, as seen in projects like 'Fantasia' and 'Lilo & Stitch.' To thrive for another century, Disney should prioritize fresh ideas over constant callbacks to the past, focusing on creating new experiences rather than catering to every nostalgic desire. Disney needs to trust in storytelling, creative minds, and progress, remembering that its iconic status was built on daring projects and learning from mistakes.","Title:Dear Disney: If you want to last another century, lay off the legacy

'They seemed primed to take over': How the Great Dying doomed the 'beast tooth' and set the stage for the dawn of the dinosaurs,"By the late Permian, therapsids known as Theriodontia ('beast tooth') displayed evolutionary innovations and seemed poised for dominance. However, at the Permian-Triassic boundary, a spike in CO2 led to warming, drying, and plummeting oxygen levels. This event, known as the Great Dying, decimated the oxygen-dependent therapsids, paving the way for the diapsids, specifically archosaurs like the earliest dinosaurs, who possessed a more efficient respiratory system suited to low-oxygen conditions. While some proto-mammals like Cynodontia survived, dinosaurs became the dominant group.","Title:'They seemed primed to take over': How the Great Dying doomed the 'beast tooth' and set the stage for the dawn of the dinosaurs

What about the Mediterranean lifestyle reduces mortality? Scientists find out,"Scientists are investigating how the Mediterranean lifestyle, characterized by a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, healthy oils (like olive oil), moderate fish and dairy intake, low red and processed meat consumption, communal meals, physical activity, and adequate rest, contributes to reduced mortality. A study in the UK found that adopting a Mediterranean-like lifestyle, adapted to local contexts, was associated with a 29% lower risk of mortality. Key elements include food consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, rest, and social habits. While short naps may be beneficial, further research is needed. Cultural adaptation using local products is crucial for successfully implementing this lifestyle in non-Mediterranean countries, with gradual changes and realistic goals being key.","Title:What about the Mediterranean lifestyle reduces mortality?

Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users,"Beeper, a multi-platform messaging aggregator, launched Beeper Mini, enabling Android users to send and receive end-to-end encrypted iMessage chats for $1.99/month. This is possible because Beeper reverse-engineered the iMessage protocol, eliminating the need for Mac server relays. Beeper claims it doesn't access message content, and unlike Sunbird, messages are encrypted on the device. Beeper Mini supports iMessage features like high-resolution media, threads, reactions, and editing, but lacks live location sharing and FaceTime. While Apple could potentially block Beeper Mini, copyright law and antitrust concerns might deter them. Beeper Mini requires a third-party audit, and it is using certificate pinning which makes network traffic analysis difficult. The company says its external audit is still in progress, but it has performed an internal audit. The team built a new service, called Beeper Push Notification service (BPNs), to make the service work. Beeper is building in public, with 50-plus projects that it’s published to GitHub with the open source code that goes into the app. Founded in 2020, Beeper has raised $16 million. Beeper Mini is now available on the Google Play Store.","Title:Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users

"If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it’s because all large trucks are","The Cybertruck's safety is debated, with concerns about its design and potential dangers to pedestrians. While specific Cybertruck data is limited, experts emphasize that large trucks in general pose a significant risk due to their weight, height, and design. Studies show trucks with tall, flat fronts are particularly deadly. Despite these concerns, independent testing is needed to determine the Cybertruck's specific safety profile. Though Tesla conducted its own crash tests, official evaluations from NHTSA and IIHS are pending. Design features such as the stainless steel exterior and potential blind spots also raise concerns. While Elon Musk asserts the Cybertruck's safety, trucks generally present a pedestrian safety nightmare. Due to its design, the Cybertruck is unlikely to be sold in Europe, which has a much higher bar for pedestrian safety than the US.","Title:If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it’s because all large trucks are

"'Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist,' says exorcist priest who warns against Ouija board use","Exorcist priest Fr. Dan Reehil warns that Ouija boards and similar practices are spiritually dangerous, not innocent fun, as they can open individuals to demonic activity.

EU lawmakers bag late night deal on ‘global first’ AI rules,"EU lawmakers have reached a political agreement on a risk-based framework for regulating AI, marking a potential ""global first."" The agreement, reached after lengthy negotiations, includes prohibitions on AI uses like biometric categorization based on sensitive characteristics, untargeted facial image scraping, and emotion recognition in workplaces and schools. While biometric identification technology in public places is not completely banned, it will be subject to safeguards and judicial authorization, limited to specific crimes. The regulation excludes areas outside EU law, national security, military/defense purposes, research, and non-professional use. 'High-risk' AI systems will face mandatory fundamental rights impact assessments, and citizens can complain about AI system decisions. General-purpose AIs (GPAIs) will have tiered obligations, with more stringent rules for 'high-impact' models. Non-compliance can result in fines up to 7% of global turnover. The law will be phased in, with full implementation potentially by 2026. France's digital minister said that he will ""ensure that the text preserves Europe’s ability to develop its own artificial intelligence technologies, and safeguards its strategic autonomy.""","Title:EU lawmakers bag late night deal on ‘global first’ AI rules

Mysterious dog respiratory illness: What to know,"A mysterious respiratory illness affecting dogs across the U.S. may be caused by a novel bacterium that evades the canine immune system, according to researchers. The illness, which has proven fatal in some cases, presents with a persistent cough, runny eyes, and sneezing. Researchers at the University of New Hampshire have identified a previously unknown germ through genetic sequencing of samples from infected dogs in multiple states. This ""funky bacterium,"" smaller and harder to detect than typical bacteria, is thought to be a new disease cause. The USDA is also investigating the illness, which has been reported in several states, including Oregon, where hundreds of cases have been reported. Symptoms manifest as inflammation unresponsive to antibiotics, chronic pneumonia, or acute pneumonia that rapidly becomes severe. Owners should ensure their dogs are vaccinated, consult with vets, and avoid crowded places like kennels and dog parks.

"‘Zoom fatigue’ is common struggle for remote workers. Here’s how to handle it, according to experts","Remote workers often experience 'Zoom fatigue,' exhaustion from constant video conferencing. Symptoms include tiredness, physical tension, moodiness, and difficulty concentrating. This isn't exclusive to Zoom; all video platforms can cause it. The pandemic normalized constant on-screen interaction, which is more tiring than in-person communication because our brains are wired for real-life cues. This can aggravate stress, anxiety, and burnout, making it difficult to interact in real life. Experts recommend turning off video when possible, taking breaks away from screens, and suggesting audio-only meetings. Turning off the self-view option can also help.","Title:‘Zoom fatigue’ is common struggle for remote workers. Here’s how to handle it, according to experts

This re-rating is supported by company and industry positives, as well as aggressive capacity addition plans. The company's revenue is secured by long-term PPAs and cost-plus tariffs ensuring a 15.5% ROE.

The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels,"The world narrowly missed a historic deal to phase out fossil fuels at COP28, though climate-vulnerable countries achieved some clean energy wins. While over 100 nations pushed for a complete fossil fuel phase-out to address a key omission in the 2015 Paris accord, the final agreement only calls for 'transitioning away' from them, a weaker commitment. The agreement does include a call to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 and accelerate the phase-down of unabated coal power. Although the UN's decision to hold the summit in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, gave the fossil fuel industry unprecedented access, solar and wind power are already cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels in most of the world when it comes to meeting new electricity demand. Nearly all of the world’s new electricity supply over the next few years is expected to come from renewable and nuclear energy.","Title:The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels
