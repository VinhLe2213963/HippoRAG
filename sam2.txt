Title:SBF’s trial starts soon, but how did he — and FTX — get here?
Passage:Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, is on trial for seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of his $32 billion crypto exchange. Co-founding FTX in 2019 after launching Alameda Research in 2017, SBF quickly attracted major investment and built high-profile partnerships. However, in November 2022, FTX collapsed following a CoinDesk report revealing that Alameda’s balance sheet was largely made up of FTT tokens, far exceeding the token's market cap. This sparked a liquidity crisis and a rush of withdrawals, leading to FTX’s bankruptcy.

SBF was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022, extradited to the U.S., and initially released on bail before being jailed again for witness tampering. Key insiders like Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX CTO Gary Wang have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. If convicted, SBF faces up to 115 years in prison. The trial marks a critical point in one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history, with many still wondering what will happen to affected investors and the billions in crypto assets.
