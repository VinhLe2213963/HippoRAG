Title:How the conspiracy-fueled Epoch Times went mainstream and made millions
Passage:The Epoch Times, a news organization linked to the Falun Gong religious group, has transformed from a free propaganda newsletter opposing the Chinese Communist Party into a successful and influential conservative media outlet. Capitalizing on the 2020 election with pro-Trump advertising and election misinformation, it experienced a staggering 685% revenue growth, reaching $122 million in 2021. Despite criticism and a Facebook advertising ban, The Epoch Times employs a mix of right-wing slant, conspiracy theories, and aesthetic journalism, attracting a subscriber base and support from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Fueled by aggressive marketing and conservative donors, the nonprofit expands its reach, hiring mainstream journalists and investing heavily in advertising while also funding affiliated Falun Gong organizations.
