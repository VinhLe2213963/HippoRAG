Title:Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president
Passage:A New York judge ruled that Donald Trump committed fraud for years by exaggerating his wealth and overvaluing assets to secure favorable loans and insurance deals. Judge Arthur Engoron, presiding over a civil lawsuit by Attorney General Letitia James, found Trump, his company, and top executives repeatedly lied on financial statements. As a result, some of Trump’s business licenses will be revoked, and an independent monitor will continue overseeing the Trump Organization.

The ruling resolves the central fraud claim ahead of a trial on six remaining charges, where James seeks $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump conducting business in New York. Trump denies wrongdoing, arguing disclaimers on his financial statements protect him, but the judge rejected this, calling it a “fantasy world.”

This civil case adds to Trump’s growing legal troubles, including multiple criminal indictments and a past conviction of his company for tax fraud. James previously sued Trump for misusing a charitable foundation, which resulted in a $2 million fine and the charity’s dissolution.
